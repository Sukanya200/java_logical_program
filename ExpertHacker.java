/*JFM1T9_Assignment2:
    Write a BankAccount class with members account_number and account_balance  and prevent other class objects 
    (assuming them as hackers who can steal your confidential information) to access BankAccount details.
    Steps to Follow:
    Step1: Create account_number and account_balance as member variables for BankAccount class
    Step 2: Add setter and getter methods for the above member variables 
    Prompt the user for the  values to be input from the terminal.

    Sample Input:
    Enter BankAccount Number : 6789023
    Enter Current Balance    : 67,000.89

    Expected Output:
    BankAccount Number : 6789023
    Current Balance    : 67000.89
